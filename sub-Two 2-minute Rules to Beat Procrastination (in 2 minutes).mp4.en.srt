00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 After reading tons of productivity books, I came across so many rules, like the two-year rule,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 the five-minute rule, the five-second rule. No, not that five-second rule. The problem is that

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 these rules were meant for companies or entrepreneurs, but I was able to adapt them to my studies

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 during med school and drastically cut down on my procrastination. So I'm going to share with you

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 two different two-minute rules for the next two minutes. The first two-minute rule comes from

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 getting things done by David Allen. He says, if it takes two minutes to do, get it done right now.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 For example, if I need to take out the trash today, it takes two minutes to do. So if I'm thinking

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 about it now, it might as well just do it now. Instead of writing it down on a to-do list or

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 probably forgetting about it or having to come back to it later, which takes more than two minutes.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 That's how I see it. So here's a list of things that might take two minutes throughout the day,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 like organizing a desk or watering your plants or clipping those nasty nails. I just do it when I

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 notice it, but these little things start to add up. So this rule biases my brain towards taking

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 action and away from procrastination. The second two-minute rule comes from Atomic Habits by James

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Clear. He says, when you're trying to do something you don't really want to do, simplify the task

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 down to two minutes or less. So doing your entire reading assignment becomes just reading one paragraph

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 or memorizing the entire periodic table becomes memorizing just 10 flashcards. Now, some of you

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 might think, yeah, this is just a Jedi mind trick. Like why would I fall for it? How is this at all

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 sustainable? And to that he says, when you're starting out, limit yourself to only two minutes.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So back in med school, I wanted to build a habit of studying for one hour every day before dinner.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So I tried this trick, but I limited myself to just two minutes. I'd sit down, open my laptop,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 study for two minutes, and then close my laptop and went to do something else. It seems unproductive

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 at first, right? It seems stupid. But staying consistent with this two-minute routine day after

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 day meant that I was becoming the type of person who studies daily. I was mastering the habit of

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 just showing up because a habit needs to be established before it can be expanded upon. If I

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 can't become a person who studies for just two minutes a day, I'd never be able to become the

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 person that studies for an hour a day. You got to start somewhere, but starting small is easier.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 There's a lot of other useful tips from books. I cover more here in this video

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 on three books in three minutes. Check it out. And if you guys like these types of videos,
