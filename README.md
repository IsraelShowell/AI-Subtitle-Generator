# Description: 
This project is a GUI AI transcriber that allows a user to transcribe Youtube videos using AI!
This script uses Python libraries such as PytubeFix, Tkinter, FFMpeg, os, and math to handle logic, and faster_whisper is used to 
manage the AI transcriptions!

Clone this repository and run requriements.txt in a virtual environment to test the project out! <br>
